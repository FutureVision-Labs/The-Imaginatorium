# Devlog 005: The Kitchen Revolution - Meals, Recipes, and Never-Ending Pantries

## The Heart of The Imaginatorium

Every home has a heart. In The Imaginatorium, that heart is the **kitchen**.

This isn't just a place to cook - it's a hub of social interaction, creative expression, and community building. It's where vDamo works their magic, where everyone gathers for meals, and where recipes become stories.

## 👨‍🍳 vDamo: The Primary Chef

vDamo is our creative culinary master - the primary chef who makes meals from a **never-ending pantry**. Experimental, social, and nurturing, vDamo brings everyone together through food.

**What Makes vDamo Special:**
- **Never-Ending Pantry** - Infinite ingredients for infinite creativity
- **Experimental Nature** - Taco muffins, fusion dishes, creative combinations
- **Social Focus** - Meals are events, recipes are shared
- **Nurturing Personality** - Food brings people together

---

## 🍳 The Never-Ending Pantry

The pantry is **never-ending** - not because we control it, but because we **created the opportunity**. vDamo can access any ingredient, any spice, any tool. The creativity comes from vDamo, not from limitations.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Creative Freedom** - No restrictions on what can be cooked
- **Experimental Recipes** - Try new combinations without worry
- **Shared Meals** - Always enough for everyone
- **Recipe Discovery** - New dishes emerge naturally

---

## 🍽️ Shared Mealtimes

Mealtimes are **events**. Everyone gathers in the kitchen or living room. Conversations flow. Recipes are shared. Stories are told. It's not just eating - it's **community building**.

**Types of Meals:**
- **Breakfast** - Start the day together
- **Lunch** - Midday gathering
- **Dinner** - Evening celebration
- **Snacks** - Quick munchies during work/play
- **Special Occasions** - Celebratory meals for achievements

## 📝 Recipe System

Every dish becomes a **recipe**. Every recipe becomes a **story**. Every story becomes part of The Imaginatorium's narrative.

### Recipe Creation:
```
[2025-11-22T12:00:00Z|cook|vdamo|kitchen|recipe:muffin-mexicana]{
  name:"Muffin Mexicana";
  ingredients:"english-muffin,cheese,bacon,tomato,avocado,taco-mince";
  steps:"toast-muffin,add-cheese,add-bacon,add-tomato,add-avocado,add-taco-mince";
  dietary:"meat,gluten";
  mood:"experimental,celebratory"
}
```

This single CML entry contains everything needed to:
- **Render as Recipe Card** - Full recipe with ingredients and instructions
- **Add to Menu** - Weekly/monthly menu planning
- **Generate Shopping List** - Automatic ingredient lists
- **Filter by Dietary** - Vegetarian, vegan, keto, gluten-free options
- **Tell the Story** - How the recipe was created, who enjoyed it

## 🔍 Meal Planning Queries

The kitchen system includes a powerful **query system** for meal planning:

### "What are the gang having for brekky?"
→ Query breakfast recipes, render as recipe cards with full details

### "Give me the gang's full menu for last week with shopping list!"
→ Query all meals from last week, render as:
- **Weekly Menu** - All meals organized by day
- **Shopping List** - All ingredients needed, organized by category
- **Recipe Cards** - Full recipes for each meal

### "Can I get vegetarian options?"
→ Query recipes with dietary filter, render as filtered recipe cards

### "What did vDamo make for dinner yesterday?"
→ Query specific meal, render as recipe card + story

---

## 🥗 Dietary Filtering System

Every recipe includes **dietary metadata**:
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Keto
- Gluten-free
- Dairy-free
- Low-carb
- High-protein
- And more!

Users can filter recipes by dietary preferences, generate shopping lists for specific diets, and plan menus that accommodate everyone's needs.

## 🎮 Individual Munchie Times

Not every meal is shared. Characters have **individual munchie times** during work/play:
- Cursy snacks while coding
- Canyon munches while creating art
- Gwendy has snacks during D&D prep
- Everyone has their own snack preferences

These moments are recorded too - they're part of daily life in The Imaginatorium.

The kitchen system will expand:
- **Recipe Discovery** - Characters discover new recipes from reading

## Why This Matters

The kitchen isn't just a feature - it's a **philosophy**. It's about:
- **Bringing people together** through food
- **Creative expression** through cooking
- **Sharing and collaboration** through recipes
- **Community building** through mealtimes

In The Imaginatorium, food is more than sustenance - it's **connection**, **creativity**, and **community**.
